<p class="style1"> The Cascade Volcanoes (also known as the Cascade Volcanic Arc or the Cascade Arc) are a number of volcanoes in a volcanic arc in western North America,
extending from southwestern British Columbia through Washington and Oregon to Northern California, a distance of well over 700 miles (1,100 km).
The arc has formed due to subduction along the Cascadia subduction zone. Although taking its name from the Cascade Range, this term is a geologic
grouping rather than a geographic one, and the Cascade Volcanoes extend north into the Coast Mountains, past the Fraser River which is the northward
limit of the Cascade Range proper.</p>
