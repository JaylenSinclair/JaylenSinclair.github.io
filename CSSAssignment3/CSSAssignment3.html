    <p> In the future, I dream I will have the ability to travel the world to see new people, and experience new cultures. One place, I am certain I will go is Los Angeles, California.
      Though in the United States, the culture of the city is much different from my hometown of St. Louis. Along with the beaches of the Pacific Ocean, LA is one of the cities with
      the most sports teams (Clippers, Lakers, Rams, Kings, etc.) It also hosts various unique landmarks such as the Santa Monica Pier, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Disneyland, and Rodeo Drive.
	     I also would like to Camp Nou in Barcelona, Spain. Home of FC Barcelona, Camp Nou has a capacity of almost 100,000 people. It is largest football stadium in Europe, and the third-largest in the world.
       One day, I hope to be able to watch the great Lionel Messi put on a show in front of the home crowd. Camp Nou is known for its roaring cheers from the diehard, passionate fans, in red and blue.
